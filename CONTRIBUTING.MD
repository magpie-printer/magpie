# Contributing to the Magpie Printer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Magpie! We rely on our community to make this project better. Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## How to Contribute

We use a standard pull request workflow for all contributions. This allows us to review changes and maintain a stable repository.

### 1. Fork the Repository

First, create a fork of the main repository to your personal GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the **Fork** button on the main repository page.

### 2. Clone and Prepare

Clone your fork to your local machine. Because this project contains large design files, please ensure you have [Git Large File Storage (Git LFS)](https://git-lfs.github.com/) installed and set up.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/magpie.git
cd magpie
git lfs install
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

### 4. Make Your Changes

Edit the code or design files as needed. Once done, stage and commit your changes with a clear, descriptive message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: A brief, descriptive message about your change"
```

### 5. Submit a Pull Request

Push your new branch to your fork and then open a pull request from your fork to our main branch.

When you submit your pull request, please include:

- A clear description of the change.  
- Screenshots or rendered images of your modifications (this is crucial as GitHub cannot visually show changes to design files).  
- An explanation of why the change is an improvement (e.g., "This design improves part strength by X%").  

We appreciate your patience during the review process. Thank you for making the Magpie even better!
