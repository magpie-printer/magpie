        Thanks for submitting a mod!

        ✅ **Attach your files right here before you click Create**
        - Drag & drop **one `.zip` file** (your mod) into the **Full description** box below.
        - You can also drag & drop 1–2 screenshots there (optional).

        If you forget, you can still add the `.zip` later in a comment — but attaching it in the form is easiest.
