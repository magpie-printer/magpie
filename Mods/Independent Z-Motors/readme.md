# Independent Z-Motor Mod

This mod allows users to use independent Nema 17 stepper motors to control Z-movement, and therefore allows for Z-tilt like a Voron Trident.


# Bill of Materials:


Non-printed parts:
 - Z motors w/ 400mm integrated leadscrews **x3**
 (that's the 1 the vanilla uses + the 2 this mod uses for a total of 3)
 - M3x14 Socket Cap Screw ***x8***
 - Laser cut acrylic bottom panel (independent motor version) ***x1***


Printed parts:

 - Right Z motor mount

 - Left Z motor mount

 *Print with 4 walls, 5 on top, 5 on bottom, 40% infill in a pattern of your choosing out of ABS or PETG

## Assembly
The **Right Z motor mount** and **Left Z Motor mount** replace the normal front bottom corners of the Magpie, and attach to the frame in exactly the same way as the parts that they replace. The only thing extra you'll need to do is to mount the Z motors to them using the 4 mounting holes each of the parts has. The motors are mounted with M3x14 Socket Cap Screws.

The final thing to note is that since you're no longer using a belt for the Z axis, you can feel free to completely omit the printing, assembly, and/or requisition of the following parts:

 - Tensioner Extension
 - Tensioner Idler holder
 - Thumb Tensioner
 - 1M GT2 closed loop belt
