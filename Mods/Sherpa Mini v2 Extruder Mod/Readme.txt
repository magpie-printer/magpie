This mod is only compatible with the revision 1 version of the Magpie toolhead. 
As of today, 11/5/25, that is the current version of the Magpie and this is up to date. 

It consists of two pieces: 
1)A modified version of the toolhead midbody with mounting holes for the sherpa mini v2
2)A modified version of the belt connector piece that had one side extended.

Assemble this toolhead as you would normally, except use a sherpa mini extruder as your extruder.
You'll still need to get the normal rearbody of the toolhead and the front cover for the toolhead from the main magpie's plated parts folder.

To mount the extruder to this toolhead revision, you'll need 
A sherpa Mini V2
2x M3 hex nuts
2x M3x20 bolts



The plated parts stl can be plopped into any slicer of your choosing, and it's already in the correct print orientation.
NO SUPPORTS NEEDED.
