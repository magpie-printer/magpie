# Magpie Toolhead – Sherpa Mini V2 Compatible Mod (Revision 1 Only)

This mod is **only compatible with the Revision 1** version of the Magpie toolhead.  
As of **11/5/25**, Revision 1 is still the current version, so this information is up to date.

---

## Overview

This modification consists of **two printed parts**:

1. **Modified toolhead midbody** with mounting holes for the Sherpa Mini V2  
2. **Modified belt connector piece** with one side extended

Assemble this toolhead as you normally would, but **use a Sherpa Mini extruder** instead of the stock extruder.  
You will still need the **standard rear body** and **front cover** from the main Magpie’s plated parts folder.

## Required Hardware

To mount the Sherpa Mini V2 extruder to this toolhead revision, you will need:

- **1× Sherpa Mini V2**
- **2× M3 hex nuts**
- **2× M3×20 bolts**

## Printing Notes

The plated parts STL can be dropped into any slicer and is already oriented correctly.

**No supports are required.**
