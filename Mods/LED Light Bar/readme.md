# LED Light Bar, light bar brackets and USB Camera bracket

I mostly use my printers remotely.  Having extra lights so I can see the printer with my web cam is nice. 

The light bars are attached using brackets to extra mounting holes.  It may interfere if you want to have a top hat/ side panels. Straight bracket is used in the front and two different size back brackets for the left and right rear.  

The camera bracket is a simple L bracket I used to velcro tie monitor mounting usb web camera.
