# BL Touch Mount

Simple mount bracket to attach BL Touch to the back of the Magpie's Tool head.

The x_carriage_rear has two M3 threaded insert attachment points.  The mount is attached to the x carriage with two M3 screws and has room for slight adjustment up or down.   

BL Touch is attached to the mounting bracket with two M3 screws directly into the printed part.

I printed the mount oriented as shown, with support.

BL Touch has the following XY offset for my build.

x_offset: 0<br>
y_offset: 35
