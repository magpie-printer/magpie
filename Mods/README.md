# 🐦 Magpie Mods

This directory is for user-created modifications and improvements for the [Magpie CoreXY 3D Printer](https://github.com/your-username/magpie-printer-project).

We encourage the community to contribute their own designs to enhance the functionality, aesthetics, or performance of the printer.

## 💡 How to Submit a Mod

To keep this repository organized and accessible, please follow these guidelines when submitting your mod:

### 1.  **Create a New Folder**
 All files for a single mod must be contained within a new folder. Please give your folder a descriptive name (e.g., `toolhead_fan_shroud`, `led_strip_mount`, `z-chain-mount`).

### 2.  **Provide a README.md** 
Inside your mod's folder, include a `README.md` file. The Mod Hub scrapes the first heading, first paragraph, and a `Made by:` line, so format your document accordingly. At minimum include:
    * A brief description of what your mod does (first paragraph after the title becomes the card summary).
    * A list of any additional hardware required (screws, nuts, wires, etc.).
    * Simple assembly instructions.
    * Any known issues or special considerations.
	* The name of the submitting author prefixed with `Made by:` so credit appears correctly.

### 3. ** PLEASE Include `.step` Files In your submission ** 
**We require all part files to be submitted in the `.step` format. You can include other things if you want, but STEP has to be in there!**

#### **Why STEP?**

The Magpie project is built on the principle of open collaboration and easy modification. By using the `.step` format, we ensure that every user can:
  * **Freely Modify:** Edit the parts in any major CAD software (Fusion 360, SolidWorks, Onshape, FreeCAD, etc.) without losing design history or running into proprietary format issues.
  * **Learn and Improve:** Analyze the part designs to understand how they work and invent new, better parts for the printer.
  * **Maintain Compatibility:** Avoid problems with different versions of software and proprietary file formats.

 **Note:** Please do not submit `.stl`, `.3mf`, or other mesh files in lieu of a proper STEP file.
 <br>
     – These files are useful for printing but are difficult to modify and are counter to the project's goal of easy design collaboration.
