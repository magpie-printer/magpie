# 2040 Extrusion Mod

This mod replaces the 400mm 2020 extrusion on the rear of the Magpie with 400mm 2040 extrusion. 
Why? because it makes it easier for people to convert Ender 3's into Magpies, and that's always a good thing. 

This mod will pair nicely with the following mods if you're coming from an Ender 3: 

 - [X/Y Endstop
   Switches](https://github.com/magpie-printer/magpie/blob/main/Mods/XY_End%20Stop/README.md)
 - [Z Axis - Lead Screw
   Mod](https://github.com/magpie-printer/magpie/blob/main/Mods/Z-Axis%20Lead%20Screw%20Mod/README.md)

# Bill of Materials:

Just use 400mm long 2040 extrusion and the printed parts here instead of  400mm long 2020 extrusion and the regular Magpie parts. 
parts should be printed with the following settings:

 *Print with 4 walls, 5 on top, 5 on bottom, 40% infill in a pattern of your choosing out of ABS or PETG
