# Mini 12864 Mounting bracket

A simple mounting bracket for mounting a [MINI 12864 LCD Display Housing for 2020 V-slot](https://www.printables.com/model/56150-mini-12864-lcd-display-housing-for-2020-v-slot) to the Magpie bottom front connector block.  M3x35 bolts are replaced with longer (M3x40 or 45) to bolt the bracket as shown.

My Mini 12864 reset button was too long to fit into the case, so I simply drilled out a hole in the case to fit.
