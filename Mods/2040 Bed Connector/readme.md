# 2040 Bed Connector Mod

This mod enables the use of 2040 aluminum extrusion for the bed mounting plate. 
Note that the mounting pattern for the POM nut has been modified so it can accept both types (the ones with 2 screw holes as used on the ender 3 and the ones with 4).

# Mounting the Bed Plate

To attach the bed mounting plate, you can either attach it the same way as you would if you were using 2020 extrusion without this mod. 
Alternatively, you can drill new holes in an bed plate. 2 sets of 2 holes which are 20mm apart to fit in the slots of the 2040. Then attached to the 2040 with 4 screws (10mm long) and t-nuts as pictured below.
