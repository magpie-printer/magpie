# 2040 Bed Connector Mod

This mod enables the use of 2040 aluminum extrusion for the bed mounting plate. 
Note that the mounting pattern for the POM nut has been modified so it can accept both types (the ones with 2 screw holes as used on the ender 3 and the ones with 4).

# Mounting the Bed Plate

To attach the bed mounting plate, You can either attach it the same way as you would if you were using 2020 extrucion. 
Alternatively, you can drill new holes in an bed plate bed mounting plate. 2 sets of 2 holes which are 20mm apart. Then attached to the 2040 with 4 screws and t-nuts as pictured below.
