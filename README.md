# Magpie
The Magpie is an open source core XY 3D printer. It's mostly printed, and can largely be built of old printers that you may have already laying around.
Design is based off of an older Rolohaun Rook design, which can be found here: https://github.com/rolohaun/Rook-180
You can put a Prusa bed on it or an Ender 3 Bed, or most other beds that can mount to a piece of 2020 extrusion.
The print area is the same as an Ender 3, and you can print a Magpie on a printer as small as a Prusa Mini.
It incorporates a P1P-style Z-axis where 3 leadscrews are driven by a single NEMA 17 stepper motor. 
You can use a p1p/P1s or X1 hotend for the toolhead.

It cost me about $200 for me to build one self sourced, but your mileage may vary. I got the price down by buying dead Ender 3's on Facebook marketplace.
